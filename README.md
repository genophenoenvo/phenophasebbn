Phenophase Bayesian Belief Network in R

This project uses:

  - the [bnlearn](https://www.bnlearn.com/) R library
  - data from the TERRA-REF project

 To develop a probabilistic network predicting phenotype transitions in *Sorghum bicolor*

## Dynamic Bayesian Belief Network Examples

- [Using bnlearn](https://www.github.com/rbartelme/phenophasebbn)
- [Introduction to Dynamic Bayesian Networks](https://www.bayesserver.com/docs/introduction/dynamic-bayesian-networks)
  * suggests starting with a non-temporal network analysis of traits
