## First Static Network Attempt Report:
*by Ryan Bartelme, PhD - June 4th, 2020*

---

### Rationale:

* First attempts at automated learning were with mixed results.

* It's probably best to think about the biology and physics of the system, and hardcode a graph structure. Then it will be easier to fit the raw data to the graph structure and see what the probabilities are at each node.

### *Using informed decisions*

* It may be best to actually link derived data

* Important to link static properties of the system

#### Examples:

* Cultivars are not moving, they are statically linked to their location

* Canopy height is linked to vapor pressure deficit (Poor, 2019)

* min/max/daily mean are linked...but maybe choosing the mean value would be best?

* The data are ordinal, that is important to specify - maybe it's important to make the time connection now?
